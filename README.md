## Introduction

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up Python on your macOS computer and install the necessary dependencies to run the **Resume Book** program.

## Installation Instructions

cd path/to/resume_book
bash start.sh
```

### 2. Enter Your Password (If Prompted)

(Note: You wonâ€™t see the password as you type, but it is being entered.)

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Denied Error

If you get a **permission denied** error when running `start.sh`, grant execution permissions by running:

```sh
chmod +x start.sh
```

Then try running the script again:

```sh
bash start.sh
```

### Python Not Recognized

If Python is still not recognized after installation, restart your terminal and check if it's installed:

```sh
python3 --version
```

## Next Steps

Once Python is installed, you can install additional dependencies by running:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
